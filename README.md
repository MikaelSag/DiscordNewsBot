Post the invite link (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1266541364657786900&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) in any text channel of the discord server and click the link to initiate the process. Follow the on screen prompts and allow the Fantasy Football Bot the required permissions.
